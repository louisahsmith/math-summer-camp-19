We read dimensions like `\(n \times p\)` as **rows** by **columns**.

I remember this as **Rapid City** because I used to live in South Dakota. You may choose a mnemonic of your own!

&lt;br&gt;

**This is a 3 x 4 matrix:**

`\(\mathbf{X}_{3 \times 4} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{11} &amp; x_{12} &amp; x_{13} &amp; x_{14}\\ x_{21} &amp; x_{22} &amp; x_{23} &amp; x_{24}\\ x_{31} &amp; x_{32} &amp; x_{33} &amp; x_{34} \end{bmatrix}_{3\times 4}\)`


If it's not clear from the context, we may write the dimensions out explicitly as above.

Individual elements are indexed in the same *row-column* order: `\(x_{23}\)` is the element in the second row and third column.

## (Note on dimensions)

We can also think of vectors as single-columned matrices:

- A column vector `\(\mathbf{y}\)` of length `\(n\)` has dimensions `\(n \times 1\)`.
.center[
`\(\begin{bmatrix}y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n\end{bmatrix}_{n\times 1}\)`
]


- A row vector `\(\mathbf{y}'\)`  of length `\(n\)` has dimensions `\(1 \times n\)`.
.center[
`\(\begin{bmatrix}y_1 &amp; y_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; y_n\end{bmatrix}_{1\times n}\)`
]

#### Thinking about vectors this way will be really handy when we multiply vectors and matrices!

---

# We can also transpose matrices
&lt;br&gt;

`\(\mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix} 30 &amp; 67 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1989 \\ 24 &amp; 63 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1995 \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 46 &amp; 72 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1973 \end{bmatrix}\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \mathbf{X}^T = \mathbf{X}' = \begin{bmatrix} 30 &amp; 24 &amp; \cdots &amp; 46 \\ 67 &amp; 63 &amp; \cdots &amp; 72 \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 1989 &amp; 1995 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1973 \end{bmatrix}\)`

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

The former columns (variables) are now rows.

The former rows (participants) are now columns.

**This will be handy mathematically (but you probably wouldn't just do it to your dataset for fun!).**

---
# In R
We can transpose a matrix using the `t()` function:

```r
t(dat)
```

```
##            [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
## age          25   38   35   36   23   26   44   23   25    41
## height       67   63   66   70   62   73   68   70   70    59
## likes_dogs    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1     0
## yob        1994 1981 1984 1983 1996 1993 1975 1996 1994  1978
```
If we save this as another object, we can extract elements using the **opposite** indices as before:


```r
dat_t &lt;- t(dat)
dat[3, 4] # participant 3's year of birth
```

```
##  yob 
## 1984
```

```r
dat_t[4, 3]
```

```
##  yob 
## 1984
```

# What do these objects represent?

It can help to visualize what these objects mean geometrically:

Let's think of a vector of length 2, representing the age and height of participants 1 and 2:

`\(\mathbf{x}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 30 \\ 67 \end{bmatrix} \qquad \qquad \mathbf{x}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 31 \\ 66.5 \end{bmatrix}\)`

# Multiplication

When we multiply a scalar by a vector or a matrix, we can just do so element by element:

`\(a\mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} ay_1 \\ ay_2 \\ \vdots \\ ay_n \end{bmatrix} \qquad \qquad \qquad a\mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix} ax_{11} &amp; ax_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; ax_{1p} \\ ax_{21} &amp; ax_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; ax_{2p} \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ ax_{n1} &amp; ax_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; ax_{np} \end{bmatrix}\)`

.center[
#### But multiplying vectors and matrices requires special rules
]

# Vector &amp; matrix multiplication

We can only multiply vectors of the same length, and we have to **transpose** one before we can do so.

- Consider two vectors of length `\(p\)`, `\(\mathbf{b}\)` and `\(\mathbf{c}\)`:

`\(\mathbf{b}^T\mathbf{c} = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_p \end{bmatrix}^T \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_p \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; b_p \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_p \end{bmatrix}\)`

`\(\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad\qquad \qquad = b_1c_1 + b_2c_2 + \cdots + b_pc_p = \sum_{i = 1}^p b_ic_i\)`

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
#### I think of this as "flopping" `\(\mathbf{c}\)` over directly on top of `\(\mathbf{b}\)`, and then summing all the products of the matching terms.
]

See why the vectors need to be the same length?

# Practice

Let's consider two vectors of length 3, `\(\mathbf{v}\)` and `\(\mathbf{w}\)`:

`\(\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{w} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}^T \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} = \; \; ?\)`

--

`\(\qquad \qquad \qquad\qquad \qquad \qquad\qquad \qquad \qquad(2 \times 4) + (4 \times 1) + (3 \times 2) = 18\)`

One situation that occurs often in statistics is the product of a vector with itself:

`\(\mathbf{b}^T\mathbf{b} = \sum_{i = 1}^p b_i^2\)`

Matrix notation makes it easy to write down a sum of squares.

Let's look at the two vectors (R prints them as rows but that's ok):

```r
v
```

```
## [1] 2 4 3

```r
w

## [1] 4 1 2

We would hope to be able to multiply them... nope!

```r
v * w

```
## [1] 8 4 6

Vector/ matrix multiplication in R requires a different operator: `%*%`


```r
t(v) %*% w
```

```
##      [,1]

# Vector `\(\times\)` matrix multiplication

When we multiply a vector by a matrix, the same idea applies, only this time we have more rows or columns to sum over.

`\(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{11} &amp; x_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{1p} \\ x_{21} &amp; x_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{2p} \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ x_{n1} &amp; x_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{np} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_p \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{11}b_1 + x_{12}b_2 + \cdots x_{1p}b_p  \\ x_{21}b_1 + x_{22}b_2 + \cdots x_{2p}b_p  \\ \vdots \\ x_{n1}b_1 + x_{n2}b_2 + \cdots x_{np}b_p \end{bmatrix}\)`

We're **flopping** the column vector repeatedly onto the rows of the matrix, and summing the products that result.

# Vector `\(\times\)` matrix multiplication, cont.

Let's look at some other ways we could write this same product:

`\(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{x_1}^T\mathbf{b}\\ \mathbf{x_2}^T\mathbf{b}\\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{x_n}^T\mathbf{b}\\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \sum_{i = 1}^p x_{1i}b_i\\ \sum_{i = 1}^p x_{2i}b_i\\ \vdots \\ \sum_{i = 1}^p x_{ni}b_i\\ \end{bmatrix}\)`

&lt;br&gt;

- The `\(\mathbf{x_1}^T\mathbf{b}\)` form illustrates how each **element** of the final product is just a **vector-vector product**

- We're using the same `\(\mathbf{b}\)` vector in each new element of our product, but a different one of the `\(n\)` rows of `\(\mathbf{X}\)` 
  - So we end up with `\(n\)` elements in the resulting vector

# Matrix `\(\times\)` matrix multiplication

Let's multiply a `\(m\times n\)` matrix `\(\mathbf{Y}\)` by the `\(n\times p\)` matrix `\(\mathbf{X}\)`:

`\(\mathbf{Y}_{m\times n}\mathbf{X}_{n\times p} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{y_{11}} &amp; \mathbf{y_{12}} &amp; \cdots &amp; \mathbf{y_{1n}} \\ y_{21} &amp; y_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; y_{2n} \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ y_{m1} &amp; y_{m2} &amp; \cdots &amp; y_{mn} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{x_{11}} &amp; x_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{1p} \\ \mathbf{x_{21}} &amp; x_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{2p} \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \mathbf{x_{n1}} &amp; x_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{np}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{z_{11}} &amp;  &amp; \cdots &amp;  \\ &amp;  &amp; \cdots &amp; \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\  &amp;  &amp; \cdots &amp;\end{bmatrix}\)`

where `\(\mathbf{z}_{11}\)` is the product of the first **row** of `\(\mathbf{Y}\)` and the first **column** of `\(\mathbf{Y}\)`

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
#### Now we need to lift out a single column vector before flopping
]

---
# Rinse and repeat
Now we do the same vector-vector multiplication with every pair of a row from `\(\mathbf{Y}\)` and a column from `\(\mathbf{X}\)`


`\(\mathbf{Y}_{m\times n}\mathbf{X}_{n\times p} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{y_{11}} &amp; \mathbf{y_{12}} &amp; \cdots &amp; \mathbf{y_{1n}} \\ y_{21} &amp; y_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; y_{2n} \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ y_{m1} &amp; y_{m2} &amp; \cdots &amp; y_{mn} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_{11} &amp; \mathbf{x_{12}} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{1p} \\ x_{21} &amp; \mathbf{x_{22}} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{2p} \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ x_{n1} &amp; \mathbf{x_{n2}} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{np} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} z_{11} &amp; \mathbf{z_{12}} &amp; \cdots &amp;  \\ &amp;  &amp; \cdots &amp; \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ &amp;  &amp; \cdots &amp; \end{bmatrix}\)`

(You don't have to do it in any particular order, just keep multiplying until all row-column pairs have been multiplied.)

`\(\qquad \qquad \; \; \; \,= \begin{bmatrix} y_{11} &amp; y_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; y_{1n} \\ \mathbf{y_{21}} &amp; \mathbf{y_{22}} &amp; \cdots &amp; \mathbf{y_{2n}} \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ y_{m1} &amp; y_{m2} &amp; \cdots &amp; y_{mn} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{x_{11}} &amp; x_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{1p} \\ \mathbf{x_{21}} &amp; x_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{2p} \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \mathbf{x_{n1}} &amp; x_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{np} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} z_{11} &amp; z_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp;  \\ \mathbf{z_{21}} &amp;  &amp; \cdots &amp; \\ \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\  &amp;  &amp; \cdots &amp; \end{bmatrix}\)`

## (Note on dimensions)

Notice that I explicitly wrote out the dimensions when multiplying `\(\mathbf{Y}_{m\times n}\mathbf{X}_{n\times p}\,\)`

Just like we can only multiply vectors of the same length, dimensions of matrices must be compatible in order to be multiplied.

.center[
&lt;iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/ZDgXvr2vpsgZG" width="480" height="257" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/ZDgXvr2vpsgZG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
]

The **inner dimensions** must match, then the resulting product is a matrix with the **outer dimensions**.

.center[
#### I think of this as the inner dimensions "collapsing"
]

# Multiplying matrices by themselves

As with vectors, we sometime need to transpose matrices to make the dimensions compatible.

Let's look at a new matrix `\(\mathbf{Q}_{2\times3}\)`:

`\(\mathbf{Q} = \begin{bmatrix} r &amp; s &amp; t \\ u &amp; v &amp; w \end{bmatrix} \qquad \qquad \qquad \mathbf{Q}^T = \begin{bmatrix} r &amp; u \\ s &amp; v \\ t &amp; w \end{bmatrix}\)`

If we wanted to multiply `\(\mathbf{Q}\)` by itself (similar to squaring a number), we can't just multiply `\(\mathbf{QQ}\)` -- first we need to transpose one of the matrices to make the dimensions compatible:

`\(\mathbf{Q}^T\mathbf{Q} = \begin{bmatrix} r^2 + u^2 &amp; rs + uv &amp; rt + uw \\ rs + uv &amp; s^2 + v^2 &amp; st + vw \\ rt + uw &amp; st + vw &amp; t^2 + w^2 \end{bmatrix}\)`

# Identity matrix

We all know 1 is special. When you multiply a number by 1, you get the same number.

Matrices have their own special matrix, the identity matrix: `\(\mathbf{I}\)`.

`\(\mathbf{XI} = \mathbf{X} \text{ for any matrix } \mathbf{X}\)`

`\(\mathbf{QI} = \begin{bmatrix} r &amp; s &amp; t \\ u &amp; v &amp; w \end{bmatrix}_{2\times3}\begin{bmatrix}   &amp;   &amp;  &amp;  \\    &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \\   &amp;   &amp;  &amp;  \\ \end{bmatrix}_{3\times3} = \begin{bmatrix} r &amp; s &amp; t \\ u &amp; v &amp; w \end{bmatrix}_{2\times3}\)`

# Symmetric matrices

The identity matrix `\(\mathbf{I}\)` is an example of a **symmetric** matrix.

&lt;br&gt;

The `\(\mathbf{Q}^T\mathbf{Q}\)` matrix we saw earlier was as well:

.center[
`\(\mathbf{Q}^T\mathbf{Q} = \begin{bmatrix} r^2 + u^2 &amp; rs + uv &amp; rt + uw \\ rs + uv &amp; s^2 + v^2 &amp; st + vw \\ rt + uw &amp; st + vw &amp; t^2 + w^2 \end{bmatrix}\)`
]

&lt;br&gt;

- The element in the `\(1,2\)` position is the same as that in the `\(2,1\)` position, the element in the `\(1,3\)` position is the same as that in the `\(3,1\)` position, and so on
- The diagonal can be anything (1s for `\(\mathbf{I}\)`, and sums of squares for `\(\mathbf{Q}^T\mathbf{Q}\)`)

.center[
#### Correlation and covariance matrices are always symmetric
]

---
# Matrix inverses

An inverse of a function is kind of like the function that takes you back to some starting point.

- For a scalar `\(a\)`, `\(a^{-1}=\frac{1}{a}\)` is the multiplicative inverse of `\(a\)`: when we multiply the two together, we get 1

- For a square matrix `\(\mathbf{X}\)`, there *sometimes* exists an **inverse matrix** `\(\mathbf{X}^{-1}\)` such that `\(\mathbf{X}^{-1}\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{I}\)` and `\(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^{-1} = \mathbf{I}\)`

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
#### It can be tricky to find, and it doesn't always exist!
]

&lt;br&gt;

In particular, if the row vectors or column vectors that make up `\(\mathbf{X}\)` are not **linearly independent**, then the inverse `\(\mathbf{X}^{-1}\)` doesn't exist.

# Intuition behind linear independence

Consider a situation in which we're predicting height as a linear function of several variables we have in our dataset: age in years, shoe size, and age in months.

`\(\textbf{height} = \begin{bmatrix} 51 \\ 61 \\ 52 \\ 65 \\ 60 \\ 48 \end{bmatrix} \qquad \qquad \textbf{other variables} = \begin{bmatrix} 30  &amp; 7 &amp; 1989 \\ 31 &amp; 10 &amp; 1988 \\ 25 &amp; 9 &amp; 1994 \\ 35 &amp; 10 &amp; 1984 \\ 42 &amp; 6 &amp; 1977 \\ 27 &amp; 7 &amp; 1992 \end{bmatrix}\)`

# Linear dependence

.pull-left[
But if we plot predicted height as a function of age in years and *age in months*, we get a line again, instead of a plane.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;


That's because age in years and age in months are **linearly dependent**: we can write one as a linear combination of the others; that is, age in months = 12 `\(\times\)` age in years.

We don't get any extra information from knowing age in months that we didn't already have from age in years.

# In "real life"

Linear dependence will come into play when we cover regression. In the meantime, we can practice some regression matrix notation! You may be used to seeing a linear regression equation written out like this:

.center[
`\(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} +\beta_1x_{2i} + \epsilon_i\)`
]

Well, that's the same thing as:

.center[
`\(y_i = \boldsymbol{\beta}^T\mathbf{x}_i + \epsilon_i\)`
]

where
`\(\;\boldsymbol{\beta} = \begin{bmatrix} \beta_0 \\ \beta_1 \\ \beta_2 \end{bmatrix}\;\)` and `\(\;\mathbf{x}_i = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ x_{1i} \\ x_{2i} \end{bmatrix}\)`

&lt;br&gt;

#### Try multiplying it out by hand, first making sure the dimensions are compatible, to be sure!

.pull-left[
We can attempt to invert a matrix using the `solve()` function:



```r
mat_a
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    2    1
## [2,]    6    8
```

```r
solve(mat_a)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]  0.8 -0.1
## [2,] -0.6  0.2
```
]


.pull-right[

We can check to make sure this is the inverse:


```r
mat_a_inv &lt;- solve(mat_a)
mat_a_inv %*% mat_a
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    0
## [2,]    0    1
```
#### We get the identity matrix `\(\mathbf{I}\)`!

# In R, cont.

What if we have a matrix whose columns are not linearly independent?




```r
mat_b
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    2    1
## [2,]    6    3
```

```r
solve(mat_b)
```

```
## Error in solve.default(mat_b): Lapack routine dgesv: system is exactly singular: U[2,2] = 0
```

#### Whenever you get an error message about something being "singular", that's code for a matrix not being invertible -- check for linear dependence! 

How could you tell the matrix above is not invertible?

[**This**](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/precalc-matrices) whole section has a lot of great information and practice with matrices. 

For a more advanced introduction, work through the sections on vectors, linear combinations, and linear dependence [**here**](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces). 

You can also pick and choose from the videos [**here**](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations), particularly those on functions and linear transformations.

# Logarithms

.left-code[
If you see `\(\log(x)\)` in this class, or basically anywhere in probability and statistics, it will refer to the natural logarithm, or `\(\ln(x)\)`.

#### What do you notice about the function `\(\log(x)\)`?

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

You can only "log" a positive number. Something like `\(\log(-1)\)` is undefined. We can see that `\(\lim_{x \to 0}\log(x) = -\infty\)`. Importantly, `\(\log(1) = 0\)`, so `\(\log(x)\)` for any `\(x\)` between 0 and 1 will give you a negative number.

# Exponentiation
.left-code[
The **inverse** of the natural log is the natural expontial function `\(e^x\)`, which we also write as `\(\exp(x)\)`:

.center[
`\(\exp(x) = y \iff x = \log(y)\)`
]

so if one side of an equation is exponentiated, we can always "get out of it" by applying a logarithm to both sides, and vice versa.

.center[
`\(\log(\exp(x)) = x\;\)` and `\(\;\exp(\log(x)) = x\)`
]

#### But we can't do that if x is negative! Recall that we can't take a log of a negative number, and exponentiating a number is never going to give us anything negative.

# Rules to live by

When we have a sum inside an exponent, we can decompose this into the product of two exponents:
`$$\exp(a + b) = \exp(a)\exp(b)$$`
Similarly, a product inside a logarithm can be written as a sum of logs:
`$$\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)$$`
Of course, the same is true of the inverses of addition and multiplication, subtraction and division:
`$$\exp(a - b) = \frac{\exp(a)}{\exp(b)}$$`
`$$\log\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \log(a) - \log(b)$$`

#### You will need to know these rules to understand various regression models in this class, I promise!

# Odds and probabilities
.pull-left[
Another important relationship! Think about flipping a coin lots of times: heads you win, tails you lose.

- A **probability** describes the number of successes out of the total number of trials (a proportion)
- An **odds** describes the number of successes compared the the number of failures (a ratio)

Let's say you get 4 heads out of 10 flips:

- probability = `\(\frac{4}{10}\)`
- odds = `\(\frac{4}{6}\)`

#### These are really different numbers!

# Logits and expits
.pull-left[
Now let's combine everything to make... the **logit** function!

![](img/recipe.gif)
]

.pull-right[

The **logit** of `\(p\)`, aka the **log-odds** of `\(p\)`, can take a number between 0 and 1 (like a probability!) and transform it to a number between `\(-\infty\)` and `\(\infty\)`.

.center[
`\(logit(p) = \log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right)\)`
]

We can invert it to get the **expit** function, which can take any number on the real line and transform it to a value between 0 and 1:

.center[
`\(expit(x) = \frac{\exp(x)}{1 + \exp(x)}\)`
]

# Derivatives

.left-code[
The basic idea of a derivative is that it describes the rate of change of a function. If the function we're looking at is `\(g(x)\)`, then there are a couple of ways we usually notate the first derivative of `\(g(x)\)`, which we'll use interchangeably:
`$$g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}g(x)$$`
Both equivalently tell us that we are looking at the function `\(g(x)\)` and taking the first derivative with respect to the variable `\(x\)`. That means that as `\(x\)` changes, we want to know how much `\(g(x)\)` changes. This is just the slope of `\(g(x)\)` at a given value of `\(x\)`.
]

.right-plot[
.center[

#### Where is `\(g'(x)\)` greatest?

.right-plot[
#### Where does `\(g'(x) = 0\)`?

When the first derivative is 0, the function may have reached its maximum or minimum.

So if you want to maximize a function, one way to do so is to differentiate it and then set it equal to 0.

# Integrals

.left-code[
We might want to describe a function by the area under its curve

An integral tells us how much cumulative space a function is covering (in terms of distance from the `\(x\)`-axis) as `\(x\)` gets larger.
]

.right-plot[
In the graph of `\(f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4\)` below, the area in blue is represented by the integral
`$$\int_{-2}^{2} 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4 \; dx$$`
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/index-3-1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

# Integrals, cont.

.left-code[
`$$\int_{-2}^{2} 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4 \; dx$$`

The values at the top and bottom of the integral sign are those between which we're computing the integral. We could integrate over the whole function, from `\(- \infty\)` to `\(\infty\)`, or choose other limits of integration:


&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

#### What limits of integration are displayed here?
]

.right-plot[

The integral of a non-negative function increases with `\(x\)`:

`$$\int_{-2}^{-1} 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4 \; dx$$`

`$$\leq \int_{-2}^{0} 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4 \; dx$$`

`$$\leq\int_{-2}^{1} 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4 \; dx$$`

`$$\leq \int_{-2}^{2} 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4 \; dx$$`

and so on. On the graph, the area under the curve can only accumulate area, so the integral evaluated at greater and greater upper limits can only increase.

# In "real life"

.left-code[
At any given year of age, everyone still alive has some probability of dying.

Yearly risk of mortality changes over time; in particular, there's a spike within the first year of life, and then a constant increase through and after middle age.
]

.right-plot[
If we're interested in cumulative risk of death by some age, we'll have to **integrate** over the yearly risk from birth to that age.
